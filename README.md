# Cezar Sas's Personal Website

This is my personal website, where I share information about myself, my research, and my work.

## Build

Run:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
cd /dist
npx serve
```

And then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Deploy

After editing, just push. GitHub Action will take care of deploying at username.github.io

```sh
git push
```
